Objectives:

•	Calculate Body Mass Index (BMI): Provide an easy way for users to calculate their BMI based on their height and weight.
•	User-friendly interface: Develop a clean, simple, and intuitive user interface (UI) to allow users to enter their details easily.
•	Health guidance: Offer health recommendations based on the calculated BMI (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese).

 Key Activities:
•	Requirement gathering and planning: Define the core features and user interface, and plan the flow of the app.
•	Design UI/UX: Create wireframes and mockups for the user interface 
•	Develop core functionality: Code the BMI calculation logic based on user input (weight and height).
•	Display results and health information: Show the BMI result along with the corresponding health classification and advice.
•	Testing: Perform functional, usability, and performance testing to ensure everything works smoothly.
•	
Technology Used:
•	Programming Language:
o	Java or Kotlin (Kotlin is preferred for modern Android development).
•	Android SDK:
o	Android Studio as the primary IDE for development.
•	User Interface:
o	XML for creating UI components (e.g., buttons, text fields).
o	Material Design for creating a modern and consistent UI with clean layouts and interactive elements.
•	Unit Conversion:
o	Implement logic to handle unit conversions (e.g., converting pounds to kilograms and meters to feet).
•	Data Validation:
o	Ensure input validation to prevent invalid data (e.g., non-numeric or negative values).
